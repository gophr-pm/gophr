# gophr
An end-to-end package management solution for Go.
## Setting up the dev environment
Firstly, make sure you have `docker` (and `docker-machine`) installed.  
Then, since the `gophrctl` tool needs to be installed for the environment to function, run the following script:
```
$GOPHR_REPO/infra/bin/setup/install
```
Afterwards, for instructions on how to use it, run:
```
gophrctl --help
```
